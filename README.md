Project description

The use of an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD) in augmented reality (AR) has significantly increased in recent years, but the alignment between the virtual scene and physical reality is still a challenge. A fast and accurate calibration method of OST-HMD is important for augmented reality in the medical field. I found a fast online calibration procedure for OST-HMD with the aid of an optical tracking system and would like to implement it with the device in our lab. Two 3D datasets are collected in this procedure: the virtual points rendered in front of the observer’s eyes and the corresponding points in optical tracking space. The transformation between these two 3D coordinates is solved to build the connection between virtual and real space. After the calibration, I am thinking using a liver phantom with fiducials attached to it to evaluate the accuracy of the calibration method.
