Project description

The use of an optical see-through head-mounted display (OST-HMD) in augmented reality (AR) has significantly increased in recent years, but the alignment between the virtual scene and physical reality is still a challenge. A fast and accurate calibration method of OST-HMD is important for augmented reality in the medical field. I found a fast online calibration procedure for OST-HMD with the aid of an optical tracking system and would like to implement it with the device in our lab. Two 3D datasets are collected in this procedure: the virtual points rendered in front of the observerâ€™s eyes and the corresponding points in optical tracking space. The transformation between these two 3D coordinates is solved to build the connection between virtual and real space. After the calibration, I am thinking using a liver phantom with fiducials attached to it to evaluate the accuracy of the calibration method.
